"""
To perform the operations on variables and its values we will use Operators.

In Python there are divides the operators into 7 groups.

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators

# **************************** 1.) Arithmetic Operators **************************
"""
Arithmetic Operators such as Addition(+) , Subtraction(-) , Multiplication(*) , 
Division(/) , Floor division(//), Exponentiation(**) and Modulus(%).
"""

a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a // b)  # Quiescent
print(a ** b)  # a to the power b
print(a % b)  # Remainder

""" 
2.)  Comparison Operators
Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b

3.) Logical Operators : and , or

4.) Identity Operators such as : is , is not

5.) Membership Operators such as : in , not in
